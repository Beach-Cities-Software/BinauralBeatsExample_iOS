# Binaural Beats Example App
Created by Russell Eric Dobda
Guided Meditation Treks

This is the core of the "Binaural" application, created by Russell Dobda in 2015
That was my first ever iOS app, and it generates sine waves to be used
for binaural beats.

This sample app is a cut-down version of that, 
which includes the core engine to create binaural beats.

Binaural beats are a sound healing technology used to create states of consciousness
